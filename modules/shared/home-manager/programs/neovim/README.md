# Neovim Config

Didn't want to go fully in on nix for neovim so hence most of the config being
left in lua files then pulling them into the nix neovim config.

Need to spend time refactoring this so I can pull in various configs into a base
neovim config. This would allow for not having work/personal/vm-specific configs
combined into one massive nvim setup.

#### After refactor

Get java specific setup working for voze work config

    - [ ] libraries
